# rcvnavigator
Uses a command line interface (CLI) to navigate to desired verse in Recovery Version (https://text.recoveryversion.bible/) or its App counterpart: Holy Bible (Recovery Version) (https://www.recoveryversion.bible/app/)

In a CLI (e.g. Terminal), ```source``` the ```rl.sh``` file (e.g. ```source rl.sh```) OR include ```rl.sh``` in your ```~/.zshrc``` file (i.e. ```. ~/rl.sh```).

Then enter ```rl``` followed by a space and a desired Bible verse reference.

Possible commands for Romans 8:11:
```
rl Romans 8:11
rl Rom. 8:11
rl rom 8:11
rl rom 8 11
```
```rl``` can be replaced with ```rw``` to look up the verse via a default browser instead:
```
rw Romans 8:11
rw rom 8 11
```
